# Q-Learning Maze Solver

## Overview

This notebook implements a Q-learning algorithm to train an autonomous agent to navigate and solve a maze. Q-learning is a reinforcement learning technique that enables an agent to learn a policy, represented by the Q-values, which maximizes cumulative rewards over time.

## Key Components:

1. **Q-Learning Algorithm**: The agent learns to make decisions based on the Q-values associated with state-action pairs.

2. **Maze Representation**: The maze is represented as a grid, where cells can be free or blocked. The agent must navigate from a start position to the maze's exit.

3. **Exploration and Exploitation**: The agent balances exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing actions based on learned values) to discover an optimal policy.

4. **Q-Values Update**: The Q-values are updated iteratively based on the observed rewards and the agent's exploration strategy.

## Workflow:

1. **Maze Creation**: Generating a maze represented as a grid.

2. **Agent Initialization**: Placing an agent in the maze with a starting position.

3. **Q-Table Initialization**: Creating a Q-table to store Q-values for each state-action pair.

4. **Training the Agent**: The agent explores the maze, updates Q-values, and refines its policy through iterations.

5. **Policy Execution**: Testing the learned policy by allowing the agent to navigate the maze based on Q-values.

## Application:

- **Pathfinding**: Q-learning can be applied to problems where an agent needs to find an optimal path in a dynamic environment.

- **Robotics**: Autonomous robots can use Q-learning to learn and adapt to various environments.

- **Game AI**: Q-learning is commonly employed in gaming scenarios where agents learn to make decisions based on rewards.

## Demonstration:

This notebook serves as a practical example of implementing Q-learning to solve a maze navigation problem. The agent learns to make informed decisions based on its experiences within the maze, eventually finding an optimal path from the start to the exit.

Key steps in the notebook:

1. **Maze Representation**: Creating a maze with defined start and exit positions.

2. **Q-Learning Implementation**: Implementing the Q-learning algorithm to train the agent.

3. **Training Visualization**: Displaying the agent's progress and learned policy during training.

4. **Policy Execution**: Allowing the agent to navigate the maze using the learned policy.

This demonstration provides insights into the Q-learning algorithm and its application in solving complex pathfinding problems.
